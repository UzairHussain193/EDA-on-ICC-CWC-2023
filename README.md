# EDA on ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 - Kaggle

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to uncover insights, trends, and patterns in the data related to the tournament.

## Project Overview

This project was inspired by a Kaggle-hosted project that initially worked on the dataset but involved limited analysis. To delve deeper, we cloned the dataset and conducted a more comprehensive analysis to explore additional performances and results.

The analysis involves:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
- Exploring player and team performance metrics.
- Visualizing key statistics such as runs, wickets, and match outcomes.
- Identifying trends in player performances and team strategies.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Explored distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Visualizations**: Created insightful plots to highlight key findings.
- **Insights**: Derived actionable insights about team and player performances.

## Tools and Libraries
